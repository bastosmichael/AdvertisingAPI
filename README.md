# AdvertisingAPI
Demo API for Advertisers

## Technologies / Libraries to leverage:
### Java 8
### Spring (http://start.spring.io/)
- Web
- MyBatis
- H2 DB
- Actuator
### Swagger Springfox
### JUnit
### Jacoco
### Gradle
### Git

## Functional Requirements:
### Advertiser
Fields
- Advertiser Name
- Advertiser Contact Name
- Advertiser Credit Limit
Manage in H2 DB
### Restful API for an Advertiser (base path = /api/advertiser)
POST new advertiser
PUT update advertiser
DELETE advertiser
GET advertiser
GET endpoint to validate if the advertiser has enough credit to perform a transaction
Properly handle errors and don't expose a stack trace through the API
### Make sure the advertiser API endpoints are accessible via a swagger UI embedded in the application at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
Do not expose the actuator endpoints via Swagger
### Make sure you have at least 90% Test coverage via gradle test for all controllers and domain models
### Make sure the end build artifact is an executable jar
### Make sure the actuator endpoints are working
Add some sort of relevant information to /info
### Add a README.md with some description on how to develop, test, run
### Must be a git repository with several commits

Share via GitHub or BitBucket, or .zip file via email, your choice

## Extra Credit options:
### POST endpoint to deduct credit from the advertiserâ€™s account
### Manage H2 Schema via Flyway
Make sure the flyway actuator endpoint is working
### Leverage Lombok Annotations in the Advertiser Model
### Build the resulting jar into a Dockerfile
### 100% Test Coverage
### Run the management / actuator endpoints on 8090 instead of 8080
### Granular git commits and commit history (no points off for code issues / mistakes throughout the git history, only judged on the HEAD git repo state)
### Any additional functionality you want to tack on :)
